## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

### Want to modify ?

- If you want to customize the asset files, do it !
- Compiling the app with **Pyinstaller** using **PitLauncher.spec** the asset folder will be packed in .exe file !
  But if you want to add some styles to it after compiling,
  there is another folder you can put style files :
  **User/AppData/Roaming/.pit/styles/**

### Style File format ?

- To add a new style file, create a **.json** file and name it, use only small letters !
- There are already a lot of styles in the project, so have a look !
